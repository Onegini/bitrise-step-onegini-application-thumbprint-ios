  Onegini Application Thumbprint iOS
summary: |
  Calculates the application's thumbprint used by the Onegini Mobile SDK
description: |
  The step is dedicated for Onegini Mobile Security Platform users, who use the Onegini Mobile SDK iOS in their iOS apps.

  The step calculates the application's thumbprint that is necessary to properly setup a mobile app project. The calculated
  value is returned in the ONEGINI_APP_THUMBPRINT so that it can be used by the developers using separate steps.

  The step requires you to have the access to the Onegini's Artifactory repository where Onegini SDKs and application
  thumbprint calculators can be found. Because of that the step requires you to provide a proper Artifactory credentials
  (username and password) as inputs.

  For Android apps please find a dedicated "Onegini Application Thumbprint Android" step.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
